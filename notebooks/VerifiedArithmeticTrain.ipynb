        "\n",
        "For the default CoLab set up, the  model has 3 attention heads, and performs 5 digit addition. The attention pattern is 18 by 18 squares (as 54321+77779=132100 is 18 tokens). Time proceeds vertically downwards, with one additional token being revealed horizontally at each token position, giving the overall triangle shape. This visualisation provided insights. After the question is fully revealed (at token position 11), each head starts attending to pairs of question digits from left to right (i.e. high-value digits before lower-value digits) giving the “double staircase\" shape. The three heads attend to a given digit pair in three different token position, giving a time ordering of heads."
